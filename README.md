# Card-Game-29
A console based card game designed to be played between user and virtual player(computer).
Rules of game:
  Each party is alloted with equal number of cards.
  Before starting the game, the player who decides to throw first is allowed to decide on a 'game color' based on the initial five cards given.
  In each round, one party throw its card and then the other party throw card of the same color as the thrown card. The party whose card's rank is more wins the round and goes for next turn. If the second party doesn't have the requisite color, then it can use the pre decided 'game color' and wins the round regardless of the card's rank. Each party gets one point per win.
  The game continues until all cards in deck is exhausted.
  The card rank is as follow:
  'K','Q','J','A','9','8','7','6','5'
  Hope you enjoy playing...
